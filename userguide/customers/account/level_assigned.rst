Level assigned manually mechanism
==================================

During :doc:`customer account creation </userguide/customers/account/account_creation>` or in :doc:`edition mode </userguide/customers/account/account_updating>` you can **set manually the level** to which the customer is assigned. 

You can simply check which of your customers have manually assigned level - on a *List of customers* in **All customers** section for every manually assigned customer record additional **Manually assigned** icon |unlink| in the Action column is displaying.

When customer has manually assigned level, he still earns points and can be promoted to the next level, but can not fall to the lower level.
    
.. warning:: 

    When customer collect enough amount of points to reach next level, he is promoted and manually assignment is automatically **Unlinked**
    
    In that case :doc:`level downgrade settings </userguide/getting_started/settings/Configuration/level_downgrade_settings>` (if applicable) can be applied and customer can fall to the lower level.   

To remove manual assignment by Admin, and allow customer to be automatically assigned to the level based on the earned points click ``Unlink`` 

You can also simply **Unlink manually assignment** also from All customers list by clicking **Unlink** icon |unlink| in the Action column.
