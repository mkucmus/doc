Redeemed rewards
================

Redeemed reward is an instance of reward that Customer has bought with Points or earned for performing specified action.

There is possibility to get:

 - virtual reward - as a Discount or Value Code, free delivery 
 - physical reward - which will be send to Customer, e.g. printed coupon, gift, etc.
 - cashback

**Not enough points from Customer perspective**

In the Client Cockpit, if Customer does not have enough points to redeem reward then Redeem reward button will be disabled (greyed out).

When mouse hover over disabled button then tooltip will show "You must have <<reward cost - customer active points>> more points to get reward"


**Redeemed reward from Admin perspective**

Redeemed reward management could be performed only from Administrator Cockpit by user who has Admin privileges.

Moreover, you can check whether reward is **Delivered** (customer choose reward and spent points but he has not used it yet) or mark as **Used** (customer used coupon code during purchase, gift was sent to customer etc.)

.. note::

    You can mark selected reward/coupon record as Used or unmark if is not used only if it's status is **Active** 
    
    When coupon status changed to **Expired** none of the above operations is possible.
 
By default all **Used** rewards receive the *Delivery status* **Ordered**. In the case of a *Used* Gift reward, additionally you can manage the status of its delivery to the customer.
