Percentage discount code
========================

After purchase customer can receive value discount for next purchase base on registered order amount. Discount is calculated base on **Transaction percentage value**. Discount will be equal percentage value of transaction provided in **Transaction percentage value** field. 

.. note:: 

    If more than one Percentage discount code campaign is available and active all will be applied. 
    
    So it is possible that the customer will receive several value codes of different value.
    

**For example**

- local currency is EUR 
- Transaction percentage value is equal 10 (i.e. 10% of registered transaction total amount) 

If Customer total amount of transaction is **100 EUR**, he will receive **10 EUR** discount for next purchase 

If Customer total amount of transaction is **47 EUR**, he will receive **5 EUR** discount for next purchase 

If Customer total amount of transaction is **32 EUR**, he will receive **3 EUR** discount for next purchase 

.. note:: 

    **Percentage discount code must be match with specified customer transaction to be used**.
    
    It can be match manually by Admin from Reward campaign list or automatically assigned within Instant reward rule
