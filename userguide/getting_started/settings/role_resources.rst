.. tip:: 

    **Transactions list and it's details preview***
    
    Even if User has no access to the *Customer* section, in *All transactions* grid and in transaction details, informations about customer related with transaction will be visible. 
  
  
.. note:: 

    **Match transaction with customer****

    To enable manually assignment transaction to customer, you must have at least a **Customers View access** (*E-mail or phone* field is required).
