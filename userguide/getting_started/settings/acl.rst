Access Control List (ACL) 
==========================

.. note::

    **Users roles and permissions (ACL settings) are related only with Admin Cockpit users**

Open Loyalty platform uses roles and permissions to create different levels of access to the Admin Cockpit. When your platform is first installed, you receive a **Super admin** role that has full permissions and give you full administrative access.

However, you can restrict the level of permissions for other admin users, who work with you. For example, a customer sevice can be given access to only the Customers, but not to areas with settings and earning rules.

.. note::

    To give someone restricted access to the Admin, the first step is to create a role that has the appropriate level of permissions.
    
    After the role is saved, you can add new users and assign the restricted role to grant them limited access to the Admin.


If an Admin userâ€™s access is restricted to specific sections and/or elements, the sections and elements for which they are not authorized will either not be visible to them, or grayed-out as inactive.

To learn more about Role resources please find :doc:`Role resources </userguide/getting_started/settings/role_resources>` section

.. warning::

    Remember that many resources are located in several sections within the Open Loyalty platform. 
    
    **For example**
    
    the level details and their creation is done in the "Levels" section, but in the "Customers" sections there is also the possibility of preview and editing the assigned level.


.. tip::

    **When assigning resources, be sure to include all sections containing resources to which user should have an access. Otherwise, users will not be able to modify or view them all.**
