Access Control List (ACL) 
==========================

Open Loyalty platform uses roles and permissions to create different levels of access to the Admin Cockpit. When your platform is first set up, you receive a **Super admin** role that has full permissions for every platform element. 

However, you can restrict the level of permissions for other admin users, who work with you. For example, a customer sevice can be given access to only the Customers, but not to areas with settings and earning rules.

If an Admin userâ€™s access is restricted to specific sections and/or elements, the sections and elements for which they are not authorized will either not be visible to them, or grayed-out as inactive.
